### This shell allows an user to dynamically convert a video files from a specified folder to MPEG-4 format. This allows to save a lot of disk space without loosing the video quality. ###

###Â Command variables ###
APT_GET=$(which "apt-get")
DATE=$(which "date")
LS=$(which "ls")
RM=$(which "rm")
SUDO=$(which "sudo")
WHOAMI=$(which "whoami")

### Creating $CURRENT_DATE variable ###
CURRENT_DATE="$DATE +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"
echo "\n$($CURRENT_DATE): The script has started."

## Determine the logged-in user and home folder filepath, creating variables ##
CURRENT_USER=$($WHOAMI)

### Checking if ffmpeg is installed ###
FFMPEG=$(which "ffmpeg")
if [ $? != 0 ]; then
  ### Install ffmpeg if missing ###
  echo "\n$($CURRENT_DATE): This shell will begin the installation of the FFMPEG binaries, as they are not present on this device. In the next step, you will get prompted for your password.\n"
  $SUDO $APT_GET update &&
  $SUDO $APT_GET install "ffmpeg"

### Continue execution. Selecting input folder ###
echo "\n$($CURRENT_DATE): The selected folder will be scanned for video files. All files that are found will be converted into MPEG-4 format.\nFolder example: $HOMEFOLDER_FILEPATH/videos\n"

### Declaring function ###

  ### Creating a loop to convert all video files in the specified folder to MPEG-4 video files ###

  ### Informing user after the conversion ###
